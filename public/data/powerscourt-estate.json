  "description": {
    "short": "Welcome to Powerscourt Estate, one of Ireland's leading tourism attractions featuring magnificent Powerscourt House and 47 acres of beautifully landscaped gardens, conveniently located just 30 minutes from Dublin.",
    "full": "Powerscourt Estate is a large country estate noted for its Palladian house and landscaped gardens, today occupying 19 hectares (47 acres) in Enniskerry, County Wicklow. The house, originally a 13th-century castle, was extensively altered during the 18th century by German architect Richard Cassels, starting in 1731 and finishing in 1741. Set amidst the stunning Wicklow landscape with views of the Great Sugar Loaf mountain, Powerscourt features a wealth of variety including perfectly manicured formal gardens, sweeping terraces, striking statues, charming ornamental lakes, secret hollows, and rambling walks. Named by National Geographic as the third finest garden across the entire globe, Powerscourt Gardens is its own world of wonder. The estate also features Ireland's highest waterfall at 121 metres (397 ft), a championship golf club, award-winning distillery, and luxury hotel. A fire in 1974 left the house as a shell until it was renovated in 1996, now housing the Avoca Terrace Cafe, retail boutiques, and exhibition spaces.",
    "history": "The original 13th-century castle was owned by Anglo-Norman nobleman La Poer (anglicised to 'Power'). During the 16th century it came into ownership of the Powerscourt family. In the 18th century, Richard Wingfield, 1st Viscount Powerscourt, commissioned architect Richard Cassels to extensively alter and remodel the medieval castle into a modern Palladian country house (1731-1741). King George IV visited in August 1821. In 1844, Mervyn Wingfield, 7th Viscount Powerscourt, inherited the estate and embarked on extensive renovation, creating the magnificent gardens inspired by visits to Versailles, Schonbrunn Palace near Vienna, and Schwetzingen Castle near Heidelberg. Garden development took 20 years to complete in 1880. In 1961, the estate was sold by the 9th Viscount Powerscourt to the Slazenger family, who still own it. The house was destroyed by fire on 4 November 1974 and renovated in 1996.",
    "architecture": "The house features severe Palladian architecture designed by Richard Cassels, with a five-bay pedimented front bookended by two circular domed towers, giving it what Sir John Vanbrugh would have called the 'castle air.' The three-storey house had at least 68 rooms. The entrance hall was 18 metres (60 ft) long and 12 metres (40 ft) wide. Main reception rooms were unusually on the first floor rather than ground floor. A mile-long avenue of beech trees leads to the house. The gardens feature the Italian Garden with dramatic sweeping terraces, Triton Lake, Japanese Garden with authentic pagoda, Walled Garden, Tower Valley with Pepperpot Tower, Pet Cemetery, statuary from across Europe, and the Bamberg Gate.",
    "culturalSignificance": "Powerscourt has been ranked No. 3 in National Geographic's World's Top Ten Gardens (2014) and nominated by Lonely Planet in the 'Top Ten Houses in the World' (2011). It is Ireland's first premier visitor attraction to be certified by Sustainable Travel Ireland. The estate has been used as a filming location for numerous productions including Stanley Kubrick's 'Barry Lyndon', 'The Count of Monte Cristo', 'Excalibur', and many others. Over 175,000 visitors explore the estate annually. The gardens represent the pinnacle of 19th-century landscape design in Ireland and contain the tallest tree in Ireland (Douglas Fir). The estate showcases nearly 800 years of Irish history from medieval castle to modern tourist destination."
