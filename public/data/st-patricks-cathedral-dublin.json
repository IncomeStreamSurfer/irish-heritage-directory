  "description": {
    "short": "Ireland's National Cathedral and the largest cathedral in the country, Saint Patrick's has been at the heart of Dublin and Ireland's history and culture for over 800 years.",
    "full": "Saint Patrick's Cathedral is the national cathedral of the Church of Ireland and Ireland's largest cathedral. Founded in 1191 by John Comyn, the first Anglo-Norman Archbishop of Dublin, the cathedral was elevated from a church dedicated to Saint Patrick, located beside a holy well where legend says Saint Patrick baptized Christian converts over 1,500 years ago. The present cathedral building, in terms of shape and size, dates from 1220-1259 and is a masterpiece of Gothic architecture. The cathedral has witnessed some of the most important developments in Christianity in Ireland and is closely associated with Jonathan Swift, author of Gulliver's Travels, who served as Dean from 1713 to 1745 and is buried here. Since 1870, the Church of Ireland has designated Saint Patrick's as the national cathedral for the whole of Ireland, drawing chapter members from each of the 12 dioceses of the Church of Ireland.",
    "history": "Founded in 1191 or 1192 when Archbishop John Comyn elevated a Celtic parish church dedicated to Saint Patrick to the status of a collegiate church. The site is beside a holy well traditionally associated with Saint Patrick's ministry in the 5th century. The medieval building was constructed between 1220-1259 in Gothic style. Jonathan Swift served as Dean from 1713-1745, and his influence remains central to the cathedral's identity. The cathedral underwent major restoration in the 1860s funded by Sir Benjamin Guinness. It has been designated as the national cathedral of the Church of Ireland since 1870, making it unique among Irish cathedrals. The cathedral continues to be a working church with daily services and is one of Dublin's most visited heritage attractions.",
    "architecture": "A magnificent example of Gothic architecture, Saint Patrick's Cathedral is the largest cathedral in Ireland, measuring 300 feet (91m) externally and 287 feet (87m) internally. The building features a 225-foot (69m) spire, soaring nave with Gothic arches, beautiful stained glass windows, medieval stone floors, and intricate carved details. The cathedral includes the Door of Reconciliation, which gave rise to the Irish phrase 'to chance your arm,' numerous memorials and monuments, the burial place of Jonathan Swift and Stella, and the famous Boyle Monument. The floor area covers 21,300 square feet with a nave width of 68 feet.",
    "culturalSignificance": "As Ireland's National Cathedral since 1870, Saint Patrick's holds unique status representing all of Ireland. It is one of Dublin's most important heritage sites and tourist attractions, welcoming visitors from around the world. The cathedral's connection to Jonathan Swift, one of Ireland's greatest literary figures, adds significant cultural importance. The phrase 'to chance your arm' originated here from a 1492 event between feuding Irish families. The cathedral maintains a world-renowned choir school founded in 1432, whose pupils sing twelve services a week during term. It serves as a symbol of Ireland's Christian heritage and continues as an active place of worship."
