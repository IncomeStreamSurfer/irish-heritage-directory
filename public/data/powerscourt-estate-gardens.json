  "description": {
    "short": "Set in the heart of the Wicklow Mountains, Powerscourt Estate features 47 acres of beautifully landscaped gardens, ranked as the third finest garden in the world by National Geographic.",
    "full": "Powerscourt Estate and Gardens is one of Ireland's most spectacular visitor attractions, featuring 47 acres of meticulously curated gardens set against the dramatic backdrop of the Wicklow Mountains and the distinctive Great Sugar Loaf Mountain. Originally a 13th-century castle, the Palladian mansion house was redesigned by architect Richard Cassels between 1731 and 1741. The magnificent gardens were created over a 20-year period from 1860 to 1880 by the 7th Viscount Powerscourt, inspired by his visits to the great gardens of Europe including the Palace of Versailles, Schönbrunn Palace and Schwetzingen Castle. The estate includes stunning Italian terraces, a tranquil Japanese garden, walled gardens with spectacular seasonal displays, Tower Valley with exotic trees, and even a charming pets cemetery. Named by National Geographic as the third finest garden in the world, Powerscourt offers visitors a magical journey through formal gardens, sweeping terraces, striking statuary, ornamental lakes, and rambling woodland walks.",
    "history": "The original 13th-century castle was owned by Anglo-Norman nobleman La Poer (anglicized to Power), whose strategic position controlled access to nearby rivers. In the 16th century, the estate came into the ownership of the Wingfield family. In 1731, Richard Wingfield, 1st Viscount Powerscourt, commissioned Richard Cassels to transform the medieval castle into a magnificent Palladian country house, completed in 1741. The gardens were developed by Mervyn Wingfield, 7th Viscount Powerscourt, who inherited the estate in 1844 at age 8. Upon reaching 21, he embarked on extensive renovations, creating the spectacular gardens over 20 years (1860-1880), inspired by European grand gardens. The house was devastated by fire in 1974 but was renovated in 1996. In 1961, the estate was sold to the Slazenger family, who continue to own it today.",
    "architecture": "The three-storey Palladian mansion house features severe facade bookended by two circular domed towers, designed by German architect Richard Cassels. The house originally had at least 68 rooms, with an entrance hall 18 meters long and 12 meters wide. The Italian terraces, which took 12 years to build with over 100 men, were influenced by Villa Butera in Sicily. The gardens feature dramatic formal planting, sweeping terraces descending to Triton Lake, life-sized winged horses (family coat of arms made by Professor Hugo Hagen in 1869), a fountain based on Piazza Barberini in Rome, authentic Japanese garden with pagoda, walled gardens, the Pepperpot Tower (modeled after Lady Wingfield's pepper pot), and extensive statuary including Apollo Belvedere and Diana collected from European travels.",
    "culturalSignificance": "Ranked #3 in the world's top gardens by National Geographic (2014) and nominated by Lonely Planet as one of the Top Ten Houses in the World (2011). The estate has been a filming location for numerous productions including Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon, The Count of Monte Cristo, Excalibur, and Into the Badlands. Ireland's first premier visitor attraction certified by Sustainable Travel Ireland. The gardens represent the pinnacle of 19th-century landscape design and continue to attract nearly 500,000 visitors annually."
