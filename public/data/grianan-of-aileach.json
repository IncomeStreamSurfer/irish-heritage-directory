    "short": "Standing on the summit of Greenan Mountain, the great stone fort known as the Grianán of Aileach commands spectacular views across Inishowen between Loughs Foyle and Swilly.",
    "full": "Standing on the summit of Greenan Mountain at 244 metres high, the great stone fort known as the Grianán of Aileach commands spectacular views across Inishowen between Loughs Foyle and Swilly, west towards Letterkenny and east towards Derry. This magnificent hillfort was the ancient royal seat of the Cenél nÉogain, a branch of the powerful Northern Uí Néill dynasty, one of the most influential families in early medieval Ireland. The stone ringfort, probably built in the 6th or 7th century CE, has been identified as the seat of the Kingdom of Ailech and one of the royal sites of Gaelic Ireland. The massive circular dry-stone wall stands about 5 metres high and 4.5 metres thick, enclosing an interior of 23.5 metres in diameter. Inside, three terraces are linked by stone steps, and two mysterious passages run within the walls. The fort is surrounded by three concentric earthen ramparts that follow the natural contours of the hilltop, creating a trivallate hillfort of exceptional significance.",
    "history": "It has been suggested that the fort was originally constructed sometime before AD 800 by the ambitious Áed Oirdnide, king of Cenél nÉogain, whose kingdom was initially confined to the Inishowen Peninsula. From this commanding hilltop, he could view both his Inishowen homeland and gaze across his newly won territories. The Grianán of Aileach served as a powerful political statement and the stronghold of royal authority for the Cenél nÉogain as they expanded throughout Ulster. The fort was inhabited by the Northern Uí Néill dynasty from approximately 789 to 1050 CE. In 1101 AD, Muirchertach Ua Briain, king of Munster, led a six-week military campaign into Ulster. Though he failed to become High King, the Annals of the Four Masters record that he ordered his army to carry away stones from the rampart, effectively decommissioning the fortress. According to legend, this was in retaliation for an outrageous event in 1088, when the Cenél nÉogain forced defeated Munster warriors to carry hazel timber all the way from Kincora to Ulster to roof a hall at the Grianán. The site fell into ruin until extensive restoration was carried out by Walter Bernard between 1874-1878, using the remains of Staigue Fort in County Kerry as an architectural model.",
    "architecture": "The main structure is a circular stone cashel (ringfort) with a massive dry-stone wall measuring 4.5 metres thick and 5 metres high. The interior measures 23.6 metres north to south and 23.2 metres east to west. A lintel-covered entrance passage extends through the wall from the east, measuring 4.65 metres long, 1.12 metres wide, and 1.86 metres high. The interior rises in three terraces accessible by stone stairways on either side of the entrance. Within the wall are two mysterious passages - one from the south and another from the northeast - that run towards the gateway but stop short. The south passage is 20.4 metres long with a small recess, while the northeast passage includes a T-junction and a seat-stone. The fort is encircled by three concentric earthen and stone ramparts that create terraced defences around the hilltop. A tumulus (possibly Neolithic) and St. Patrick's Well are located outside the main structure. The restoration work of the 1870s rebuilt much of the collapsed stonework, marking undisturbed portions with tar and supplementing with additional stones from the area.",
    "culturalSignificance": "One of the royal sites of Gaelic Ireland and the seat of the Kingdom of Ailech. The fort represents the power and influence of the Northern Uí Néill dynasty who ruled from this commanding position for over 250 years. The Metrical Dindshenchas, an early Irish text revealing the origins of place names, refers to it as 'Aileach Frigrenn, green-sward of the world's royal kings, fortress to which led roads horse-trodden, through five ramparts.' The site is deeply embedded in Irish mythology, with legends connecting it to the Tuatha Dé Danann and the god Dagda, who supposedly built it as a burial place for his son Aed. The site was also used as a Mass rock during the anti-Catholic religious persecution that began under Henry VIII and ended with Catholic Emancipation in 1829. Today it stands as a protected National Monument and powerful symbol of ancient Irish kingship."
