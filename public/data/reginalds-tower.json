  "description": {
    "short": "Once described as 'a massive hinge of stone connecting the two outstretched wings of the city', this tower has never fallen into ruin and has been in continuous use for over 800 years.",
    "full": "Reginald's Tower stands as Ireland's oldest civic building, a testament to over 800 years of continuous use. Originally the site of a wooden Viking fort, the stone tower we see today was built by the Anglo-Normans who made it the strongest point of Waterford's medieval defensive walls. The tower has never fallen into ruin and has served countless purposes throughout its long history - from royal mint to military arsenal, from prison to civic building. Its circular stone structure, rising 54 feet above the quays of Waterford, has witnessed the entire sweep of Irish history from the Vikings through Norman conquest, English rule, and into modern times. Today it houses the Viking Collection of the Waterford Museum of Treasures, bringing the story full circle to its Norse origins.",
    "history": "The site was originally occupied by a wooden Viking fort before the Anglo-Normans conquered Waterford and built the stone tower in the early 13th century (1200s). The tower's name derives from Raghnall (Reginald), a Gaelicised form of the Old Norse name Røgnvaldr, possibly referring to one of Waterford's Viking rulers. Under King John, it was utilised as a royal mint. Throughout subsequent centuries, it served various functions under many English monarchs, including storage for weapons, gunpowder, and cannons during Waterford's turbulent periods. In the 19th century it housed a prison, and the Chief Constable's family became the last residents of the tower. The building has been in continuous use for over 800 years, making it unique among Irish civic structures.",
    "architecture": "Reginald's Tower is a circular fortified tower built of stone, standing 54 feet tall with a diameter of 42.5 feet. Its thick stone walls and strategic position made it the strongest point of Waterford's medieval defensive walls. The tower features original spiral staircases that wind upward through multiple floors. The Anglo-Norman construction replaced the earlier Viking wooden fortification while maintaining the defensive character of the site. Its circular design and robust masonry exemplify medieval military architecture.",
    "culturalSignificance": "Reginald's Tower is Ireland's oldest civic building and holds the unique distinction of being the only urban monument in Ireland to retain a Norse or Viking name. It represents the layered history of Waterford - from Viking settlement through Norman conquest to modern times. The tower has witnessed royal visits, military conflicts, commercial trade, and civic governance. Its continuous occupation for over 800 years makes it an irreplaceable link to Ireland's medieval past and Viking heritage."
