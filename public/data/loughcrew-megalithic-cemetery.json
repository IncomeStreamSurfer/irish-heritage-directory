  "description": {
    "short": "The Loughcrew Megalithic Cemetery, also known as the Hills of the Witch, are a group of Neolithic passage tombs near Oldcastle in County Meath. Spread over four undulating peaks, the tombs are of great antiquity, dating to 3000 BC.",
    "full": "The Loughcrew Megalithic Cemetery, also known as Sliabh na Caillaigh (the Hills of the Witch), comprises one of Ireland's most significant collections of Neolithic passage tombs. Dating to approximately 3000 BC, these ancient monuments predate both Stonehenge and the Egyptian pyramids by several centuries. Spread across four undulating hilltops in County Meath, the cemetery contains over 30 passage tombs, making it one of the largest megalithic complexes in Ireland. The site offers visitors a unique combination of archaeological significance, stunning megalithic art, astronomical alignments, and breathtaking panoramic views across the Irish midlands. Unlike more commercialized sites, Loughcrew provides an intimate, uncrowded experience where visitors can connect directly with Ireland's ancient past.",
    "history": "Constructed around 3000 BC during the Neolithic period, Loughcrew represents the architectural and spiritual achievements of Ireland's early farming communities. These passage tombs served as both burial chambers and ceremonial centers, demonstrating sophisticated knowledge of astronomy, engineering, and stone carving. The tombs were built by transporting massive stones up steep hillsides and carefully positioning them to create corbelled chambers aligned with celestial events. Archaeological excavations have revealed cremated human remains, pottery, bone pins, and pendants, providing insights into Neolithic burial practices and beliefs. The site's Irish name, Sliabh na Caillaigh (Hills of the Witch), comes from the legend of a witch who created the cairns by dropping stones from her apron as she leaped from hilltop to hilltop. The tombs remained largely undisturbed for millennia until archaeological investigations began in the 19th and 20th centuries, revealing their extraordinary significance.",
    "architecture": "The Loughcrew complex consists of over 30 passage tombs distributed across four hilltops: Carnbane East, Carnbane West, Patrickstown Hill, and Newtown Hill. Cairn T on Carnbane East is the largest and most impressive, measuring approximately 35 meters in diameter. It features a cruciform chamber with a beautifully corbelled roof and contains some of the finest examples of Neolithic megalithic art in Ireland. The passage and chamber are precisely aligned to capture the sunrise at the spring and autumn equinoxes, when sunlight illuminates intricate carvings on the backstone. The carvings include spirals, circles, radial patterns, zigzags, and solar symbols - abstract designs whose exact meanings remain mysterious. Many stones feature the distinctive Loughcrew style of megalithic art, with symbols that may represent astronomical observations, spiritual beliefs, or territorial markers. Outside Cairn T sits the 'Hag's Chair' or 'Witch's Seat,' a decorated stone throne offering spectacular views. Other significant tombs include Cairn L on Carnbane West, aligned to sunrise at Samhain and Imbolc, and Cairn S with its exceptional stone carvings.",
    "culturalSignificance": "Loughcrew stands as a testament to the astronomical knowledge, engineering prowess, and artistic sophistication of Neolithic Ireland. The precise solar alignments at the equinoxes demonstrate detailed understanding of celestial movements and the changing seasons - knowledge crucial for agricultural communities. The site's megalithic art represents some of the most accomplished stone carving from prehistoric Europe, with designs that continue to fascinate archaeologists and visitors alike. As a less-commercialized alternative to Newgrange, Loughcrew offers an authentic, contemplative experience of ancient Ireland. The equinox gatherings, where people assemble at dawn to witness the solar illumination, continue a tradition spanning five millennia and create a profound connection between modern visitors and Ireland's Neolithic ancestors. The site is protected as a National Monument and represents an irreplaceable cultural heritage."

On her final leap, she stumbled and broke her neck, and was buried beneath the cairns she created.",
